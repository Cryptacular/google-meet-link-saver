# Google Meet Link Saver (Chrome extension)

People sometimes send useful links in a Google Meet chat but there's no way of retrieving those unless you've recorded the session with transcript. This Chrome extension automatically saves all links sent in a Google Meet chat and displays them in the handy popup (when you click the icon in the extension bar).

To install it, you can find it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-link-saver/omajhjbeikfnbbmhhmhmfhfdkkdngbme).
